# Autonomous Parking System

> A Raspberry Pi based intelligent system that leverages Lidar and OpenCV to autonomously detect, align, and park in a marked parking zone.

---

### 📌 **Project Overview**
- **Objective:** Design and test a system capable of detecting parking zones and controlling motor movements for automated parking maneuvers.
- **Methodology:** Implemented on Raspberry Pi using Lidar for distance mapping and OpenCV for parking space recognition. Motors controlled through H-bridge circuits based on real-time feedback.

### 💡 **Key Features**
- Real-time lane/slot detection  
- Path planning based on Lidar map  
- Self-correcting reverse/turn sequences  
- Camera + Lidar hybrid system
